# Operating-Systems-Kernel-Modules
Worked on Linux Kernel to familiarize on kernel development and modules.

The first project was a warm-up exercise to help us become familiar with the virtual machine (VM) and Linux software that was extensively for our kernel development throughout the semester. In this exercise, we had to add a new module and system call to the kernel.

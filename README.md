# Operating-Systems-Projects
Worked on Linux Kernel to familiarize on kernel development and modules.

The first project was a warm-up exercise to help us become familiar with the virtual machine (VM) and Linux software that was extensively for our kernel development throughout the semester. In this exercise, had to add a new module and system call to the kernel.
